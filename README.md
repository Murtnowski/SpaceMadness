# SpaceMadness

Space Madness is a demo game a wrote to test out websockets.  I wanted to create a game which runs entirely server side and the browser is simply used a shell console for interacting.

The ship's modules will automatically make resources while they are online.  Crew members can be assigned to a module to increase its output.  The output drops as the health of the module falls.  Crew members can be assigned to repair the health of a module.  As the oxygen level drops, so does the crew's ability to work.  Don't let your crew be over taken by space maddess or they will not listening to you.
